Alright, you've got the compiler installed, now it's time for some testing:

* Downloading the [FIR.hs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clash-lang/clash-compiler/master/examples/FIR.hs) example
* Run `clash --interactive FIR.hs`
* Execute, in the interpreter, the `:vhdl` command.
* Execute, in the interpreter, the `:systemverilog` command.
* Exit the interpreter using `:q`
* Examine the VHDL code in the `vhdl` directory
* Examine the SystemVerilog code in the `systemverilog` directory
